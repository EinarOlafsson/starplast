# 64.10 · Complete the categorical-label benchmark records

Status: OPEN — 0%, 2026-10-07. Existing foundations are reused; completion of this acceptance contract is not yet verified.

Parent: [64 · Information space and inference atlas](64_information_space_and_inference_atlas.md).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Depends on | 64.05, 64.06, 64.07, 64.08, 64.09 |
| Estimated remaining engineering time | 6–12 h |
| Existing code to inspect | `starplast/track_record.py`, `starplast/strategy_catalog.py`, `starplast/strategy_learning.py`, `starplast/scorecard.py` |

## Deliverable

Native held-out label outputs, including class-score or prediction-set fields where produced, for all label-capable strategies in the capability map.

## Controlled scope

Categorical-label task only; one new adapter per validated commit, first on a frozen pilot target.

Implement one coherent change at a time. Record the frozen pilot scope before expensive jobs.
If this item needs additional sources, tasks or unplanned algorithm changes, register a bounded
follow-up and its dependency rather than silently widening the item.

## Done when

- [ ] Reuse the existing 14-strategy record; add missing label-capable adapters one at a time with native-prediction parity.
- [ ] Every eligible labelled gene has a held-out call or an explicit abstention; rare and unsupported classes are retained as evaluation gaps.
- [ ] Precision, recall/F1 by class, coverage, baselines and confusion outcomes derive from those rows; conformal calls report coverage and set size/singleton efficiency.
- [ ] Relevant automated checks and any required biological benchmark evidence are recorded, including failures and gaps.
- [ ] The result is reviewable, the parent tracker is updated, and the validated change is committed and pushed to nightly.

## Completion evidence

Pending: commit, checks, artifact/benchmark identities, measured population, limitations and dated result.
